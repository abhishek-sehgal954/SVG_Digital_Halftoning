Algorithm:
1. First, intensity of each pixel is calculated on a scale of 0 to 9. (0 being the lowest intensity)
2. Then each pixel according to its intensity is mapped into a block of 3*3 . 
	
     ---   ---   ---   -X-   -XX   -XX   -XX   -XX   XXX   XXX
     ---   -X-   -XX   -XX   -XX   -XX   XXX   XXX   XXX   XXX
     ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   -X-   -X-   XX-   XX-   XXX
      9     8     7     6     5     4     3     2     1     0       (0 being the blackest point).

    Now mapping to a block of 3*3 works in case of raster images i.e. when we are creating raster halftone from raster images, but to create SVG halftone we have to map intensity levels to some mathematical figure. So what we did is, we mapped our intensity level to 
    	a. Circle
    	b. Triangle
    	c. Hexagon. 
    0 mapped to the maximum area Circle/Triangle/Hexagon. 
 3. Then using python library svgwrite we created the SVG halftone.
